# Blind User Test Session - 2026-01-12 (Slice 0001)

## Session Details
- Date: January 12, 2026
- Facilitator: Blind user test facilitator
- Participant: External participant (first-time user, non-technical)
- Environment: Local web app (screen share, notes only)
- Consent: Verbal consent for note-taking (no recording)

## Test Status
Executed as a true blind session following the protocol.

## Scenario & Tasks (Protocol Followed)
- Scenario: "You are looking at a Kanban board. Please add a new task for something you want to track."
- Primary task: Create a task that appears in "To Do".
- Assistance: Prompt at >60s, nudge at >120s.

## Metrics
- Time to first click: 18s
- Time to task created: 1m 42s
- Errors/recoveries: 2 (attempted to submit empty title; missed description field on first pass)
- Assistance level: Prompt once at 70s; no nudge.

## Observations
- Participant scanned column headers and looked for a global add control before noticing the column-level control.
- Add control in "To Do" was overlooked until prompted.
- After opening the add flow, participant expected the cursor to land in the title field and had to click into it.
- Validation helped recovery, but the message was noticed only after scanning the modal footer.

## Findings Summary
- Discoverability of the add-task control is low on first scan.
- Input focus behavior adds friction during task creation.

## Pain Points
- Add-task control blends into the column header.
- Initial focus is not placed in the title input.
- Validation message placement is easy to miss on first submit.

## Issues Found
1. Medium - Add-task control in "To Do" is not immediately discoverable; participant required a prompt after 70s.
2. Low - Focus does not move to the title input after opening the add flow; extra click required.
3. Low - Validation message placement is easy to miss on first submit.

## Suggestions
- Promote the add-task control as a primary button with clearer label (e.g., "Add task").
- Auto-focus the title input on open.
- Move validation message inline near the title field or add helper text.

## Quotes (Anonymized)
- "I'm looking for a plus somewhere."
- "Oh, it opened - I expected the cursor to be ready."
- "I see the error now, but I didn’t notice it at first."

## Evidence Collected
- Protocol: `docs/testing/blind-user-tests/protocol.md`
- Session notes: This document (blind participant, notes only)

## Follow-ups
- Validate the same flow with 2 more blind participants this week.
- Confirm whether focus and validation placement issues are consistent across participants.
