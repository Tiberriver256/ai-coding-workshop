# Tech Debt Sprint — 2026-01-12

## Scope
- Current slice focus: Slice 0001 (Kanban task creation) and supporting test/docs tooling.
- Reviewed areas: tests, docs drift, scripts/tooling, file-length compliance, feature duplication.

## Hotspots Observed
- BDD drift risk: the new drift check flags mismatches in `agent-execution-monitoring.feature`, `github-support.feature`, `remote-session-access.feature`, `task-orchestration.feature`, and `code-review.feature`, plus a missing `encrypted-point-to-point-connectivity.feature` mirror.
- File-length policy conflict: `package-lock.json` exceeds the 500-line rule; several files are near the limit.
- Test coverage depth: automated acceptance evidence exists only for Slice 0001; BDD automation is not enforced in CI.
- Docs drift: prior file-length audit report was outdated vs. current repo state.

## Prioritized Fixes (Top 3)
1) Enforce BDD feature drift check. (Implemented)
   - Evidence: `scripts/check-bdd-drift.sh`, `package.json`, `docs/testing/strategy.md`.
2) Reconcile drifted BDD feature files. (Carded)
   - Card: `docs/kanban/cards/bdd-feature-drift-reconcile.md`.
3) Decide and implement lockfile policy for the 500-line rule. (Carded)
   - Card: `docs/kanban/cards/file-length-policy-lockfiles.md`.

## Quick Wins Completed
- Added a BDD drift check script and npm entry.
- Documented the drift check in the testing strategy.
- Refreshed `docs/plan/file-length-audit.md` with 2026-01-12 scan results.

## Backlog / Follow-ups
- Expand automated acceptance coverage beyond Slice 0001 (BDD or Playwright) and record evidence.
- Add CI guardrails for drift checks and file-length checks once lockfile policy is decided.
- Monitor near-limit files and capture split plans before they exceed 500 lines (carded in `docs/kanban/cards/near-limit-file-splits.md`).
