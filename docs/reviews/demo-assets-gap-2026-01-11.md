# Demo Assets Gap Log — 2026-01-11

## Gap Summary
Sprint review assets (video + screenshots + QR/mobile proof) were missing at the start of the sprint review request.

## Root Cause
- No explicit demo-asset gate in the delivery checklist.
- Demo capture was not coupled with acceptance testing.

## Resolution
- Demo asset pack produced and stored under `docs/reviews/sprint-review-2026-01-11/`.
- Registry created at `docs/reviews/demo-assets-registry.md`.

## Prevention
- Add a demo-asset readiness gate to the release checklist.
- Capture demo assets during the acceptance test session.
