# slice-definition-checklist

## Goal
Roll out the slice definition checklist and readiness tags for slice-related work.

## Why
Strengthen shared signals so downstream work starts only when definitions are clear.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `docs/plan/slice-definition-checklist.md` exists and is referenced by slice cards.
- Slice-related cards show a readiness tag (Ready / Needs Definition / Blocked).
- Card updated with summary and evidence links.

## Owner
Delegate: Technical writer + Orchestrator.

## Status
Done

- Evidence: `docs/plan/slice-definition-checklist.md`, `docs/kanban/cards/slice-0001-definition.md`, `docs/kanban/cards/slice-0001-thin-poc.md`

## Summary
Linked the slice definition checklist on Slice 0001 cards and confirmed readiness tags align with the Ready/Blocked signals.
