# feature-sliced-linter

## Goal
Research Feature-Sliced Design and add repo-specific guidance plus a linter for naming/structure.

## Why
We need a consistent file/folder naming scheme informed by feature-sliced methodology.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Clone the feature-sliced documentation into `research-output/feature-sliced-documentation`.
- Add guidance at `docs/folder-structure/feature-sliced-guidance.md` (<=500 lines).
- Add linter script at `scripts/check-feature-sliced.sh` (exit non-zero on violations).
- Update `docs/folder-structure.md` with references.
- Update kanban card with summary and evidence.
