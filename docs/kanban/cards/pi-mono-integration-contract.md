# pi-mono-integration-contract

## Goal
Document a shared integration contract for pi-mono so CLI and mobile work from the same assumptions.

## Why
The CLI and mobile APK depend on pi-mono behavior, and missing integration signals risk parallel drift.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `docs/plan/pi-mono-integration-contract.md` created with CLI entrypoint, ready log signal, expected flags, and dependency notes.
- `docs/kanban/cards/cli-executable.md` and `docs/kanban/cards/mobile-apk.md` link the contract as a prerequisite.
- Kanban card updated with summary and evidence link.

## Owner
Delegate: Backend engineer (pi-mono) + Mobile engineer.

## Status
To Do

## Summary
Pending.

## Links
- PR/commit: (pending)
- Evidence: `docs/plan/pi-mono-integration-contract.md`

## Notes
- Align with pi-mono architecture in `~/repos/pi-mono`.
- Keep file under 500 lines.
