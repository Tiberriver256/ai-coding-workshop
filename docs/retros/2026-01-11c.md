# Retro 2026-01-11c

## Context
- Focus: research-to-delivery chain (web research, BDD pivot, CLI executable, mobile APK).
- Evidence reviewed: `docs/retros/inputs/2026-01-11c-meadows.md`, `docs/retros/inputs/2026-01-11c-dorigo.md`, `docs/kanban/cards/web-research-codex-pi-mono.md`, `docs/kanban/cards/bdd-feature-pivot.md`, `docs/kanban/cards/cli-executable.md`, `docs/kanban/cards/mobile-apk.md`.

## Meadows (Systems Leverage Points)
- **Goal clarity:** Make sprint-review outcomes explicit: one runnable CLI, one APK, and one traced BDD slice with evidence.
- **Rules/constraints:** Require a BDD slice plan before implementation work starts and require evidence links before "Done."
- **Information flows:** Centralize dependency visibility from research to BDD plan to CLI/Mobile so work starts on current assumptions.
- **Structure of WIP:** Gate CLI/Mobile execution work behind verified research and slice definition to prevent rework.
- **Delays:** Publish a short implications brief immediately after research completes to shorten downstream delays.

## Dorigo (Stigmergy / Swarm Coordination)
- **Signals:** Add dependency tags (Research -> BDD plan -> CLI/Mobile) on the four critical cards so sequencing is visible.
- **Evidence trails:** Require a single evidence index per workstream so the swarm converges on one authoritative signal.
- **Integration contract:** Create a shared pi-mono integration contract note and link it from CLI and Mobile cards.
- **WIP focus:** Keep CLI + Mobile to two active items until research and BDD mapping are ready.
- **Readiness gating:** Only move CLI/Mobile cards to In Progress once dependency tags are marked Ready.

## What Went Well
- Delegate inputs surfaced the binding constraint (research + BDD plan) and made dependencies explicit.
- Delivery goals (CLI, APK, BDD slice) are clear enough to translate into acceptance evidence.

## What Didn't
- Research, BDD plan, CLI, and Mobile cards lack dependency tags and readiness cues.
- Evidence links remain pending across delivery cards, weakening the "done" signal.
- No documented pi-mono integration contract exists to align CLI and mobile expectations.

## Decisions
- Treat the research brief and BDD slice plan as prerequisites for CLI/Mobile execution work.
- Add dependency tags and readiness states to the four delivery chain cards.
- Create a pi-mono integration contract note and link it from CLI and Mobile cards.
- Create evidence index stubs for Research, BDD Plan, CLI, and Mobile workstreams.
- Require a lightweight evidence checklist on each delivery card (command run, artifact path, test reference).

## Actions (Concrete)
- **Applied immediately (2026-01-11):** Created `docs/kanban/cards/pi-mono-integration-contract.md` and added it to `docs/kanban/board.md`.
- Publish `docs/research/web/codex-pi-mono.md` and a one-page implications brief linked from dependent cards by 2026-01-12 (Owner: Web researcher).
- Create `docs/plan/bdd-slice-plan.md` with Slice BDD-0001 and link it from CLI/Mobile cards by 2026-01-12 (Owner: Feature analyst + QA lead).
- Add dependency tags and readiness states to `web-research-codex-pi-mono`, `bdd-feature-pivot`, `cli-executable`, and `mobile-apk` cards by 2026-01-12 (Owner: Orchestrator).
- Draft `docs/plan/pi-mono-integration-contract.md` and link it from CLI/Mobile cards by 2026-01-13 (Owner: Backend engineer).
- Create evidence index stubs for Research, BDD Plan, CLI, and Mobile and link them from the cards by 2026-01-13 (Owner: Technical writer).
