# Retro 2026-01-11

## Context
Initial orchestration setup. Delegate inputs collected; binding constraint is an unclear Slice 0001 definition and acceptance criteria, plus weak readiness signals on the board.

## Meadows (Systems Leverage Points)
- **Goal clarity:** Define Slice 0001 outcomes so work optimizes toward a shared target instead of local assumptions.
- **Rules/constraints:** Establish a single acceptance-criteria checklist to reduce interpretation variance and rework.
- **Information flows:** Make slice definition status and open questions visible on the board.
- **Buffers:** Add a short definition review before architecture/testing work begins.

## Dorigo (Stigmergy / Swarm Coordination)
- **Signals:** Slice definition is a weak shared signal; add a checklist and readiness tags to strengthen stigmergy.
- **WIP:** Board shows a WIP limit of 5 but the lane signals are weak; add a per-lane cap of 3 for In Progress.
- **Dependencies:** Require explicit readiness cues before moving cards to In Progress.
- **Evidence trails:** Require evidence links on Done cards to guide follow-on work.

## What Went Well
- Bootstrap artifacts created.
- Delegate inputs captured quickly with actionable recommendations.

## What Didn't
- Slice definition clarity lagged behind architecture/testing work, increasing rework risk.
- Readiness cues and dependencies were not visible on most cards.
- Evidence links were inconsistent, reducing traceability.

## Actions
- **Applied immediately:** Published `docs/plan/slice-definition-checklist.md` and linked it for follow-on use.
- Run a 30-minute definition review at the start of each cycle; capture unresolved questions in the slice doc within 24 hours.
- Add readiness tags (Ready / Needs Definition / Blocked) and do not move a card to In Progress unless Ready.
- Add a per-lane WIP cap of 3 for In Progress; keep global WIP at 5 delegates.
- Require evidence links on every Done card, starting with the 2026-01-11 retro items.
