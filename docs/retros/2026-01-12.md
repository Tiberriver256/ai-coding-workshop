# Retro 2026-01-12 (Merged Meadows + Dorigo)

## Context
- Slice focus: Slice 0001 task creation baseline, evidence quality, and coordination hygiene.
- Inputs: `docs/retros/2026-01-12-meadows.md`, `docs/retros/2026-01-12-dorigo.md`.
- Evidence reviewed: `docs/plan/slice-plan.md`, `docs/plan/bdd-slice-plan.md`, `docs/testing/acceptance/slice-0001.md`, `docs/testing/acceptance/INDEX.md`, `docs/testing/blind-user-tests/2026-01-12.md`, `docs/kanban/board.md`.

## Key Findings
- **Goal clarity + UX signal:** “Create a task” must be discoverable and fast without prompts; current affordances and focus behavior risk slower completion.
- **Evidence flow gaps:** Acceptance evidence exists but isn’t surfaced on the board, weakening the shared signal.
- **WIP + readiness gating:** Global WIP exists but no per-slice guardrails or explicit parallelization tags.
- **Drift control:** Automated tests are strong, but blind-test signal needs to be promoted into board actions and acceptance criteria.

## Actions (Concrete)
1) **Slice 0001 usability fixes** — Add a kanban card covering discoverability, autofocus, validation placement; link blind-test evidence. Due 2026-01-13. Owner: UX + Frontend.
2) **Acceptance definition update** — Add a blind-test check (time-to-task + prompt-free completion target) to Slice 0001 acceptance. Due 2026-01-13. Owner: QA.
3) **Autofocus + validation test** — Add Playwright checks for title autofocus + inline validation visibility. Due 2026-01-14. Owner: QA + Frontend.
4) **Board/evidence sync** — Align `docs/kanban/board.md` with card status and add evidence links for slice-complete cards. Due 2026-01-13. Owner: Orchestrator.
5) **Dependency + parallel tags** — Add dependency/parallelization tags to Slice 0001/0002 cards and gate readiness in card headers. Due 2026-01-14. Owner: PM + QA.
6) **Slice evidence line** — Add a “Slice Evidence” line linking `docs/testing/acceptance/INDEX.md` to slice cards. Due 2026-01-14. Owner: QA lead.
