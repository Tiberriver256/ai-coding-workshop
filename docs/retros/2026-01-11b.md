# Retro 2026-01-11b

## Context
- Focus: close the demo-asset readiness gap (video, screenshots, QR proof) as a release gate.
- Evidence reviewed: `docs/plan/release-checklist.md`, `docs/testing/strategy.md`, `docs/kanban/cards/demo-assets-gap.md`, `docs/kanban/board.md`.

## Meadows (Systems Leverage Points)
- **Goal clarity:** Treat demo assets as release-critical, not optional, so the system optimizes for demonstrable outcomes.
- **Rules/constraints:** Require a Demo Asset Pack per slice (video + screenshots + QR proof) before release can advance.
- **Information flows:** Centralize demo-asset status with direct links from acceptance evidence and kanban cards.
- **Feedback loops:** Capture demo assets during testing to close the evidence loop immediately after a known-good run.
- **Buffers/delays:** Allocate explicit capture time and shorten the delay between feature completion and asset capture.

## Dorigo (Stigmergy / Swarm Coordination)
- **Signals:** The demo-asset gap needs a visible shared signal; the existing card is not reflected on the board.
- **Readiness gate:** Add a lightweight demo-asset definition of ready/done and attach it to demo-impacting cards.
- **Evidence trails:** Ensure Done cards link to demo assets via a single registry index.
- **WIP focus:** Cap demo-asset work at 2 concurrent items to keep capture/editing focused.
- **Tags:** Use Demo-Ready / Demo-Needs-Asset tags and require Demo-Ready before moving to Done.

## What Went Well
- Retro inputs were delivered quickly and aligned on the demo-asset gap as the binding constraint.

## What Didn't
- The release checklist lacks a demo-asset readiness gate.
- Evidence trails do not converge on a single demo-asset location.
- Demo-asset capture is not yet coupled to testing sessions, increasing evidence debt.

## Decisions
- Define a Demo Asset Pack: 60-90s walkthrough video, 3-5 screenshots of critical flows, and QR pairing proof.
- Create a demo-asset registry index to serve as the single source of truth for assets.
- Require Demo-Ready / Demo-Needs-Asset tags on demo-impacting cards.
- Enforce a WIP cap of 2 concurrent demo-asset items.
- Require demo-asset evidence links for any demo-impacting card moved to Done.

## Actions (Concrete)
- **Applied immediately (2026-01-11):** Created `docs/kanban/cards/demo-assets-production.md` and added it to the board to track Demo Asset Pack production and registry work.
- Add a demo-asset readiness gate and Demo Asset Pack checklist to `docs/plan/release-checklist.md` by 2026-01-12 (Owner: Product manager).
- Publish the demo-asset registry at `docs/reviews/demo-assets-registry.md` and link it from demo-impacting cards by 2026-01-12 (Owner: Technical writer).
- Update acceptance evidence entries to include a demo-asset link and enforce Demo-Ready tags before Done by 2026-01-13 (Owner: Orchestrator).
- Schedule demo-asset capture during end-to-end testing sessions and note it in `docs/testing/strategy.md` by 2026-01-13 (Owner: QA lead).
