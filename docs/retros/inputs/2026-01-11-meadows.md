# Meadows Retro Input 2026-01-11

## Context Snapshot
- Evidence reviewed: `docs/plan/cycle-notes/2026-01-11-cycle-01.md`, `docs/kanban/board.md`.
- Binding constraint: unclear Slice 0001 definition and acceptance criteria.
- Focus: complete slice definition and align architecture + testing around it.

## Leverage Points (highest leverage first)
1) **Goal clarity (system purpose).** Define Slice 0001 outcomes so the system optimizes for a shared target instead of local guesses.
2) **Rules and constraints.** Establish a single acceptance-criteria checklist for Slice 0001 to reduce interpretation variance and rework.
3) **Information flows.** Make slice definition status and open questions visible on the board to tighten coordination feedback.
4) **Buffers.** Add a small decision buffer (timeboxed definition review) before architecture/testing work begins.

## Feedback Loops
- **Reinforcing loop (ambiguity -> rework):** Unclear slice definition increases interpretation variance, which increases rework and delays, which further erodes clarity as people rush to catch up.
- **Balancing loop (WIP limit -> focus):** WIP limit pushes focus, but without clear slice definition the focus amplifies the wrong work; the balancing loop fails to stabilize outcomes.

## Actions (3)
1) Publish a one-page Slice 0001 definition with explicit acceptance criteria and edge cases; review with all delegates before new work starts.
2) Add a visible board signal (tag or checklist link) that blocks architecture/testing tasks until definition is approved.
3) Run a 30-minute definition review at the start of each cycle; capture unresolved questions in the slice doc within 24 hours.

## Expected Impact
- Faster convergence on shared goals, reduced rework, and clearer handoffs between definition, architecture, and testing.
