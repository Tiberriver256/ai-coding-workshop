# Dorigo Retro Input 2026-01-11c

## Scope
Stigmergy/swarm coordination analysis focused on the research-to-delivery chain spanning web research, BDD pivot, CLI executable, and mobile APK cards.

## Observations (Stigmergy Signals)
- Four critical cards (`web-research-codex-pi-mono`, `bdd-feature-pivot`, `cli-executable`, `mobile-apk`) are all in To Do with no explicit dependency tags, so the swarm lacks a shared pheromone trail for sequencing.
- Evidence links are marked pending across the delivery cards, which weakens the signal for what “done” looks like and prevents downstream tasks from self-routing to verified inputs.
- The CLI card depends on pi-mono architecture in another repo, but there is no local integration signal (contract or checklist) to coordinate changes, increasing the risk of parallel drift.
- The BDD pivot card requires feature file mapping, yet there is no visible bridge between BDD scenarios and the CLI/mobile deliverables, so test signals are fragmented.

## Stigmergy Improvements
- Add dependency tags (Research -> BDD plan -> CLI/Mobile) on the four cards and surface them in the board so agents can pull in the correct order without sync.
- Create a shared “integration contract” note for pi-mono (CLI entrypoint, ready log, expected flags) and link it from both CLI and mobile cards to unify signals.
- Require a single evidence index per workstream (Research, BDD Plan, CLI, Mobile) so pheromone trails converge on one authoritative location.

## WIP Limits (Proposal)
- Cap active delivery work (CLI + Mobile) at 2 concurrent items until research and BDD mapping are complete.
- Only move CLI or Mobile cards to In Progress once their upstream dependency tags are marked Ready.

## Actions (3)
1. Add dependency tags and readiness states to the four cards by 2026-01-12.
2. Draft and link a pi-mono integration contract note (CLI entrypoint, ready log, flags) by 2026-01-13.
3. Create evidence index stubs for Research, BDD Plan, CLI, and Mobile and link them from the cards by 2026-01-13.
