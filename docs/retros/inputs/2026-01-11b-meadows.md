# Meadows Retro Input 2026-01-11b

## Context Snapshot
- Evidence reviewed: `docs/plan/release-checklist.md`, `docs/testing/strategy.md`.
- Requested evidence missing: `docs/kanban/cards/demo-assets-gap.md` not found in repo.
- Focus: close demo-asset readiness gap (video, screenshots, QR proof) as a release gate.

## Leverage Points (highest leverage first)
1) **Goal clarity (system purpose).** Make demo assets part of release readiness, not a nice-to-have, so the system optimizes for demonstrable outcomes.
2) **Rules and constraints.** Add a non-negotiable “Demo Asset Pack” requirement per slice (video + screenshots + QR proof) before release can advance.
3) **Information flows.** Centralize demo-asset status in one place with direct links from acceptance evidence and kanban cards to remove ambiguity.
4) **Feedback loops.** Capture demo assets during testing so the evidence loop closes immediately after a successful run.
5) **Buffers.** Allocate explicit time/capacity for capture and review to avoid last-minute scrambling.
6) **Delays.** Shorten the delay between feature completion and asset capture by coupling capture to the same session.

## Feedback Loops
- **Reinforcing loop (evidence debt):** Missing demo assets leads to late stakeholder requests → ad hoc capture → rework/interruptions → less time to capture → more missing assets.
- **Balancing loop (release gate):** A visible demo-asset checklist gate blocks release until assets exist, stabilizing readiness and reducing last-minute churn.

## Actions (3)
1) Define a “Demo Asset Pack” checklist: 60–90s walkthrough video, 3–5 screenshots of critical flows, and QR pairing proof for the onboarding path.
2) Add an explicit demo-asset section to acceptance evidence entries and require links before moving a card to Done.
3) Schedule capture during the same session as end-to-end testing (per `docs/testing/strategy.md`) to ensure screenshots/recordings are collected while the system is known-good.

## Expected Impact
- Earlier proof of readiness, fewer release surprises, and a tighter loop between testing and stakeholder-facing demos.
