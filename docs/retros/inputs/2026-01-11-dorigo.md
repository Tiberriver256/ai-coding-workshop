# Dorigo Retro Input 2026-01-11

## Scope
Stigmergy/swarm coordination analysis based on the current cycle note and Kanban board state.

## Observations (Stigmergy Signals)
- The binding constraint is a vague Slice 0001 definition, which is a weak shared signal for downstream work.
- The board advertises a WIP limit of 5 delegates yet has 7 items queued in To Do, risking diffuse attention without clear pull signals.
- Only one blocked card is visible; remaining work lacks explicit dependencies or readiness cues.

## Stigmergy Improvements
- Strengthen shared signals by publishing a short "slice definition checklist" and attaching it to any slice-related card before it moves to In Progress.
- Add readiness tags to cards (Ready / Needs Definition / Blocked) so swarm agents can self-route without synchronous coordination.
- Require evidence links on every Done card and use them as pheromone trails for follow-on tasks.

## WIP Limits (Proposal)
- Keep global WIP limit at 5 active delegates.
- Add a per-lane WIP cap of 3 for In Progress to preserve swarm focus.
- Do not move a card to In Progress unless its readiness tag is Ready.

## Actions (3)
1. Create a lightweight "slice definition checklist" and link it from all slice cards by 2026-01-12.
2. Add readiness tags to all retro and audit cards and refresh the board by 2026-01-12.
3. Enforce evidence-link completion when moving cards to Done starting with the 2026-01-11 retro inputs.
