# Dorigo Retro Input 2026-01-11b

## Scope
Stigmergy/swarm coordination analysis focused on the demo-asset readiness gap, using the release checklist and board signals.

## Observations (Stigmergy Signals)
- There is no visible `docs/kanban/cards/demo-assets-gap.md` artifact; the absence of a shared signal makes the gap easy to ignore.
- The release checklist is strong on testing and documentation but lacks an explicit demo-asset readiness gate, so the swarm has no pheromone trail for “demo-ready” outputs.
- Done cards link to evidence, yet those trails do not converge on demo assets (screens, recordings, scripts), leaving downstream stakeholders without a single beacon.

## Stigmergy Improvements
- Add a lightweight demo-asset definition of ready/done and attach it to any card that claims demo impact.
- Create a visible demo-asset registry (single index with links to assets) so evidence trails converge on one shared location.
- Tag cards with Demo-Ready / Demo-Needs-Asset and enforce tag visibility on the board to enable self-routing.

## WIP Limits (Proposal)
- Cap demo-asset work at 2 concurrent items to keep capture/editing focused.
- Require a Demo-Ready tag before moving a card to Done when demo impact is claimed.

## Actions (3)
1. Create the missing demo-asset gap card and link it to the registry by 2026-01-12.
2. Add a demo-asset readiness gate to `docs/plan/release-checklist.md` by 2026-01-12.
3. Require an evidence link to a demo asset (or registry entry) for any demo-impacting card starting now.
