# Meadows Retro Input 2026-01-11c

## Context Snapshot
- Evidence reviewed: `docs/kanban/cards/web-research-codex-pi-mono.md`, `docs/kanban/cards/bdd-feature-pivot.md`, `docs/kanban/cards/cli-executable.md`, `docs/kanban/cards/mobile-apk.md`.
- Binding constraints: missing upstream research + BDD plan create cascading ambiguity for CLI and mobile deliverables.
- Focus: tighten goal clarity, sequencing, and evidence flow so sprint-review outputs are predictable.

## Leverage Points (highest leverage first)
1) **Goal clarity (system purpose).** Make the sprint-review outcomes explicit: one runnable CLI, one APK, and one traced BDD slice with evidence.
2) **Rules and constraints.** Require a BDD slice plan before implementation work starts, and require evidence links per card before “Done.”
3) **Information flows.** Centralize dependency visibility (research → BDD plan → CLI/Mobile) so downstream work does not start on stale assumptions.
4) **Structure of work-in-process.** Gate CLI/mobile execution work behind verified research + slice definition to prevent rework.
5) **Delays.** Shorten delay between research and implementation by publishing a brief “implications” summary immediately after research completes.

## Feedback Loops
- **Reinforcing loop (ambiguity → rework):** Missing research and BDD mapping → implementation guesses → rework and delays → less time for research and mapping → more guessing.
- **Balancing loop (evidence gate):** Evidence-linked acceptance criteria block status changes until proof exists, stabilizing delivery quality and sprint-review readiness.

## Actions (3)
1) Produce a one-page “Codex/pi-mono implications” brief and link it from all dependent cards within 24 hours of research completion.
2) Publish `docs/plan/bdd-slice-plan.md` with a single selected Slice BDD-0001 and link it from CLI/mobile cards as a prerequisite.
3) Add a lightweight evidence checklist (command run + artifact path + test reference) to each delivery card and keep it current.

## Expected Impact
- Reduced rework, faster decision-making, and higher confidence that the CLI and APK are demo-ready at sprint review.
