# UX Review 2026-01-12

## Scope
- Web: `app/index.html` (task creation, pairing, review, monitoring)
- Mobile: `app/mobile/index.html` (pairing, sessions, task lists)

## Summary
The core flows are present and visually coherent, but several steps lack clarity about state, next actions, or ownership (especially monitoring and pairing). Mobile exposes only a read-only subset of review workflows, which may confuse users given the “Mobile Review” framing.

## Findings and Recommendations

### 1) Monitoring lacks task/attempt selection and clear ownership
- Evidence: The Task View panel opens a single log stream and shows “No attempt selected,” while controls (Pause/Stop/View Processes) remain active.
- Impact: Users cannot tell which task they are monitoring or whether actions affect a real task.
- Recommendation: Add a task/attempt selector in the Task View header; disable monitoring controls until a selection is made; display the active task title next to the status pill.

### 2) Monitoring controls don’t support resume after pause
- Evidence: “Pause stream” sets status to Paused but the control label never changes; the only way to restart is re-opening the view.
- Impact: Users lose context and may assume the stream is broken.
- Recommendation: Toggle the button to “Resume stream” and keep the stream state visible (Streaming/Paused/Stopped).

### 3) Task creation modal doesn’t explain “Create” vs “Create & Start”
- Evidence: Two primary actions exist without explanatory text; “Create & Start” implies background behavior not described.
- Impact: Users may pick the wrong action or avoid starting attempts.
- Recommendation: Add helper copy under the buttons or switch to a single primary action with a “Start immediately” checkbox.

### 4) Assistant enablement is ambiguous inside the task modal
- Evidence: The Copilot CLI option is disabled with no inline explanation or link to the Settings panel where it can be enabled.
- Impact: Users may assume the assistant is unavailable or broken.
- Recommendation: Add an inline note like “Enable Copilot CLI in Settings to use this option” with a shortcut link or icon hint.

### 5) Pairing modal lacks live status feedback
- Evidence: The QR modal explains how to pair but doesn’t show “Waiting for approval” or “Approved” states; status only appears in the Devices panel.
- Impact: Users don’t know if pairing is progressing without leaving the modal.
- Recommendation: Add a pairing status line in the modal (Pending/Approved/Rejected), and auto-close or show a success state when approved.

### 6) Mobile “Review” experience is read-only and incomplete
- Evidence: Mobile shows To Do/Done only; no In Progress/In Review states, no review actions, and no task detail drill-down.
- Impact: The “Mobile Review” label overpromises compared to what’s available.
- Recommendation: Either rename to “Mobile Status” or add an “In Review” section with lightweight review status and comments summary.

### 7) Pairing controls on mobile are always visible but often disabled
- Evidence: Approve/Reject buttons appear even when there is no request; they are disabled with minimal guidance.
- Impact: Increases visual noise and reduces confidence.
- Recommendation: Hide the buttons when there is no request; replace with a contextual helper that appears only when a request is active.

## Quick Wins (1–2 hours)
- Add monitoring task selector + disable controls when no selection.
- Toggle Pause/Resume with visible stream state.
- Add “waiting for approval” status in the pairing modal.

## Longer-Term Enhancements
- Expand mobile review to include In Review/In Progress states and comment summaries.
- Add a post-review confirmation state or toast on Send.
